## Joe Newman

I'm a classic career-changer. I've worked as a Chartered Accountant in financial services for most of my career but I now feel that it's time to do something that genuinely stimulates me. Why software development? Mainly because during my career when working with developers I've found that reviewing their code was far more interesting than reviewing financial statements! And creating prototype applications for them was truely fulfilling. Makers Academy has enabled me to learn quickly the fundamentals of coding and I'm now looking to use these skills with a reasonably small team in a creative and hard-working environment, preferably with a back-end programming focus.
